        <h2 id="Amazon-Consumer-Sentiment-and-Behavior-Analysis-Based-on-Artificial-Intelligence"><a href="#Amazon-Consumer-Sentiment-and-Behavior-Analysis-Based-on-Artificial-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Consumer Sentiment and Behavior Analysis Based on Artificial Intelligence"></a><center>Amazon Consumer Sentiment and Behavior Analysis Based on Artificial Intelligence</center></h2><h3 id="INTRODUCTION"><a href="#INTRODUCTION" class="headerlink" title="INTRODUCTION"></a><center>INTRODUCTION</center></h3><p>The sentimental analysis is one of the most important parts in the artificial intelligence.It is a kind of technology in natural language processing and a common method in text excavating, which main function  is to determine whether a given paragraph or sentence  is positive or negative based on the known text and emotional symbols.It is an interdisciplinary subject of economics and sociology, which is an important part of market research.When large-scale information needed to analysis,the way  analyzing by human eyes is extremely inefficient .For instance,on amazon or twitter,  people post their comments about an item, event or person.These comments may be good or bad, so the sentimental analysis is used to categorize these information,then turn these trivial information into data. As a result merchants can use sentimental analysis tools to know users’ experience and evaluation of their products directly instead of finding these feed back from many comments.A good handling of sentimental analysis can greatly improve the efficiency of people’s understanding of things, and can also use the conclusion of sentimental analysis to serve other people or things. Further more ,many companies use people’s views and attitudes on a certain company, a certain industry and a certain thing to predict their future trend of stocks to help them make a decision. </p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science. People are trying to make a kind of machine that can simulate human thought patterns in response.It is the process that simulate people’s cognition and analysis of information including the simulation of consciousness.However, the artificial intelligence can not become the human intelligence, but it can be the intelligence surpassing human. Machine Learning is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence。Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model to train data to make the decisions without program.A commonly used method of machine learning is logistic regression, a method of fitting data into a model.</p>
<h3 id="DATASET"><a href="#DATASET" class="headerlink" title="DATASET"></a><center>DATASET</center></h3><p>reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on Amazon.com. The data set can be used to find out insights with respect to reviews, ratings, price and their relationships. Data was acquired in December, 2016 by the crawlers</p>
<h3 id="Data-Visualization-And-Exploratory-Data-Analysis"><a href="#Data-Visualization-And-Exploratory-Data-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Data Visualization And Exploratory Data Analysis"></a><center>Data Visualization And Exploratory Data Analysis</center></h3><p>Data visualization is mainly aimed at conveying and communicating information clearly and effectively by pattern , then achieve in-depth insight into relatively sparse and complex data sets by looking at the graph.Creating visualizations will make things easier to understand, especially for large and mess data sets.When we finished data visualization, the final result can be presented in a clear, concise and compelling way.However, designers often fail to strike a good balance between design and function, thus creating a incorrectly form of data visualization that fails to achieve its main purpose that is trying to convey and communicate information.</p>
<p>When we are doing the data visualization, we will use pandas to do data visualization.It is a tool used in data collection and storage, as well as data modeling and prediction, also used for data mining and cleaning.It provides many ways to deal with the data that most for data frame and series.</p>
<p>After we finished data processing,we will use the data to make graphs in order to make them easier to read and understand. </p>
<p>When we begin the data visualization.We need to use exploratory data analysis to help us start the first step of cleaning the data.</p>
<p>Exploratory data analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns spot anomalies to test hypothesis and to check assumption with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.</p>
<p>Use the example of analysis the comments of people wrote on the website.</p>
<p>First and foremost,we need to quickly check the data set.For example like how many number of rows/columns, is there any data loss, what is the data type and data preview.Then we clean the data, delete the useless parts and leave only the data we need.<br>Secondly,we make different definition to different types of data.Like define the positive word and negative words.Use python to find the positive and negative words, then put them in different group.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we use these different type of data to make a graph.Such as Histogram, pie chart, line chart.As a result people are able to understand the feedback of comments.<br>However, sometimes there will be some long comments in the website. So we can not use the positive words and negative words to separate them.So we need to record the frequency of occurrence and add some special sentence to distinguish them.</p>
<h3 id="Problem-Formulation"><a href="#Problem-Formulation" class="headerlink" title="Problem Formulation"></a><center>Problem Formulation</center></h3><p>Our problem is a binary classification problem. The input data is the text of customers’ phone review, the output is 0/1 binary labels which represents the customers’ preference for this phone – like or dislike. </p>
<p>To make the Artificial Intelligence analyse the data quickly, we need to use problem formulation in order to make the Artificial Intelligence is able to analyse different types of data.To form these methods of artificial intelligence, we need to teach them how to use methods to analyse data type.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to text a label, definition of  the label can be good or bad, then we will choose characteristics, choose what is good and what is bad, after choosing we will feature dimension reduction, dimension reduction is to reduce the number of features that can make the program run faster. </p>
<p>Secondly, we use language text into characteristics, after that the expressed characteristics of text is divided into development set and test set, the development set is divided into training set and test set, then we will select the best classification algorithm and the characteristic dimension of development focus,The test set is used to verify the accuracy of emotion classification</p>
<p>Finally,we pick the most efficient algorithm as the formula for artificial intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="Feature-Engineering"><a href="#Feature-Engineering" class="headerlink" title="Feature Engineering"></a><center>Feature Engineering</center></h3><p>The bags of words is the model that help computer collect data from words, this program ignore grammar and word order , and the text is only regarded as a collection of words, and the appearance of each word in the document is independent.Bow uses a set of words with no orders to express a paragraph of text or a document.However, here are some problems of bags of words are that any information about the order or structure of words in the sentence is discarded.</p>
<p>The bags of Ngrams a kind of statistical language model that predict the next item based on the previous item.At the application level, these items can be characters, words, we can generate from large text or audio corpus n - gram model, n - the thought of gram language model, can be traced back to the master shannon’s information theory research, he put forward a problem: given a string of letters, such as “for the ex”, what is the next biggest possibility of letters.For example when we add some characters like he in the input method, we will get words like help, here, hear, heat… Moreover, more characters you put in this N-grams, the more accurately predict of words you want to output.</p>
<h3 id="Algorithm"><a href="#Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Algorithm"></a><center>Algorithm</center></h3><p>Logic Regression is used for sorting tasks, the storing task Input variables and output variables are finite discrete variables. For instance, when we want to predict whether a person healthy or unhealthy and predict what’s his sign, the result has only a few  multiple values, we can category each values , then predict object exactly what kind. These questions referred to as a classification problem. If a classification problem is only the result of the two, such as “yes” and “not” two results, we put the results for “yes” on the sample data is called “positive,” the results for “not” on the sample data is called “negative”, These results of variable called discrete variables.</p>
<p>Gradient descent method is a kind of optimization method based on search, its function is to minimize a loss function, mean, at some point in the variable space, have the greatest rate function along the gradient direction, then the optimization objective function, the nature is to reduce the negative gradient direction function value, to achieve our optimization goal</p>
<h3 id="Experimental-Design-and-Results"><a href="#Experimental-Design-and-Results" class="headerlink" title="Experimental Design and Results"></a><center>Experimental Design and Results</center></h3><p><strong>Experimental Design:</strong></p>
<p>The data set is divided into training, validation and test data set. Models are trained and tuned on training data set. Hyper-parameters are selected using validation data set. Then, we use tuned models to predict labels on the test data set.<br>We used two methods of feature engineering. One is bag-of-words and another is bag-of-Ngrams. Experiment is set up for comparing those different feature engineering methods<br>(The metric we are using is F1-Score)</p>
<p> <strong>Results and Analysis:</strong></p>
<table>

</tbody></table>
<p>We use both bags of words and bags of Ngrams to collect data, compare to the method of Bags of Words and bags of Ngrams, we found out that the accuracy of the bags of Ngrams is higher than bags of words.I think the reason cause the difference is the information lose of the Bags of Words, however, the Bags of Ngrams still keep some order of the information, as a result it has a better performance.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>In this experiment we are trying to find a method to increase the efficiency for Artificial Intelligence to collect data from texts and analyse these data that classify them into positive or negative.So we use two methods of Bags of Words and Bags of Ngrams to find a best way.Experiment is set up for comparing those different feature engineering methods.Finally, we find out that Bags of Ngrams keep the order of the information in order to make the computer easier to run the program ,as a result it has a better performance.</p>
